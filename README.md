## Things/Features left out

Features that I had initally planned on implementing but couldn't finish because of the time constraint.

1. A proper UI. Could have improved the UI/UX if the time permitted for an iterative development. I chose to take on the task with an incremental approach.
2. Provider side screens. Couldn't finish the provider sided screens in time.
